<h1>Bruno's Letterboxd Top Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Sci-fi not so fi, with top notch pratical effects and memorable acting.</p>

<h3>SpeedRacer</h3>
<p>Adrenaline-injecting action with visuals so unique that we will probably never see again.</p>

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>Greatest animation of all time, it was the only VHS tape I had when I was a child.</p>
